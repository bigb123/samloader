### Licensing statement, June 19 2023

I, nlscc, the former maintainer of samloader, make the following statement:
```
LICENSE ADDENDUM STATEMENT

"Relevant Works" are the text of all commits authored by nlscc and uploaded
using the former nlscc GitHub account, insofar as they form a set of
instructions to modify a previous version of the source code (i.e. a set of
diffs), but excluding any text not authored by me but required to implement the
instructions.

The Relevant Works have been released into the public domain. Any previous
licenses applying to the Relevant Works are therefore null.

All rights vested in the Relevant Works, copyright or otherwise (including but
not limited to 'moral' rights), have been irreversibly waived, and
notwithstanding the above nlscc hereby covenants not to attempt to assert the
same.

For the avoidance of doubt this statement does not apply to commits authored by
people who are not nlscc.
```
